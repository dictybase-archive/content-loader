The Insall laboratory approaches this problem using multiple experimental systems. It is envisaged this work will use a combination of Dictyostelium genetics and cancer cell molecular cell biology, though we are interested in quantitative analysis, so findings will be confirmed using computational analysis and modelling. The work will focus on mechanisms that generate and promote the growth of new actin pseudopods (see Andrew & Insall, NCB 9, 193 & Ura et al., Curr Bio 22:553). Techniques will involve some of: High-level microscopy on multiple platforms including TIRF, FRET/FLIM and FRAP, Dictyostelium growth & genetics, mammalian cell culture and transfection, and biochemical assays of actin function.  \n\n A relevant PhD is essential. Experience in Dictyostelium genetics, protein biochemistry, fluorescence microscopy, Java and/or MatLab programming, cloning and genetics, and a good record of quality publications would be an advantage.
